# ***🚀 ToonTanks 🎮***

Welcome to ToonTanks! Because who doesn't want to control a cartoon tank and blow things up for fun? 😅 What started as a "simple" Udemy tutorial quickly turned into an epic journey of tank battles, AI trickery, and endless debugging. Created using Unreal Engine 5, this project was my playground for learning the ins and outs of game development, Blueprints, and C++ programming.

### **🎮 Game Features**
- **🔥 Tank Combat System:** Players control a tank, battling enemies with smooth movement and satisfying firing mechanics. (Yes, blowing things up is as fun as it sounds.)
- **🧠 Enemy AI:** AI-driven enemies that actually fight back—because who needs an easy win, right?
- **💥 Health and Damage System:** Both tanks (player and enemies) have health points—so it’s not just about firing, but also staying alive.
- **🎯 Shooting Mechanics:** Accurate and responsive tank cannon mechanics that make you feel like a real commander on the battlefield.
- **🌍 3D Environment Design:** Engaging and colorful visuals to keep things lively while you're dodging enemy fire.

### **🧠 What I Learned**
- **👨‍💻 Core Gameplay Mechanics:** Implemented core gameplay using Blueprints and C++—turns out tanks and coding do mix.
- **🎮 Player & Enemy Behavior Design:** Designed engaging interactions that keep the battles dynamic (and frustratingly fun).
- **🏗️ Project Structuring:** Learned how to manage and structure a game project within Unreal Engine 5—because good organization beats chaos every time.
- **🛠️ Debugging & Troubleshooting:** Fixed bugs and made things work after countless, head-scratching moments (coffee helped).

ToonTanks has been an incredible learning experience, and I'm excited to take everything I've learned here and roll it into future projects. Bigger tanks, bigger battles—who knows what's next? 😄
